Dependencies:
  - Use in ubuntu Linux
  - Eigen3 (sudo apt install libeigen3-dev)

Compile:
  - Goto ./BaseCode (the folder containing CMakeLists.txt)
  - Open folder in Terminal (~/(user path)/BaseCode)
  - Execute the following commands:
    - mkdir build  (Create build folder)
    - cd build     (Goto build folder)
    - cmake ..     (Build the applications)
    - make         (Create 2 executables: BaseCode, Visibility)

Run:
  - First, run the Visibility executable (inside ./build type: ./Visibility)
  - This will create 2 visibility .txt files inside ../../extras/grid folder
  - Then, run the BaseCode executable (inside ./build type: ./BaseCode)
  - Wait a minute, it will need to create some model Levels-of-Detail (LODs) first
  - The created LODs will be stored in the same folder as the models (../../extras/models)

Enjoy!
